# PHP FFI examples for Platform.sh

This project contains two applications in a multi-app configuration.

The `points-c` directory contains an FFI example using a custom C library.  It can be accessed at `c.<domain-name>`.

The `points-rust` directory contains an FFI example using a custom Rust library.  It can be accessed at `rust.<domain-name>`.

This project is intended as reference code only.  It is installable on Platform.sh but will not be continually maintained.
